        <p>
          Hello, I am Nur Arini, a Freelance Frontend Web Developer who is currently expanding my skills in Backend Development. Based in Bandung, West Java, I am passionate about building modern and responsive web applications that deliver great user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated from SMKN 1 Majalaya with a major in Computer and Network Engineering, which gave me a solid technical foundation. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in frontend technologies like React, NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, creating clean and intuitive web interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am focusing on backend development to become a more versatile developer. I am learning how to build scalable server-side applications, manage databases, and handle API integrations. My goal is to master full-stack development and work on projects that have a positive impact on users.
