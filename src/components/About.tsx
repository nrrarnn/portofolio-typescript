      <p>
        Hello, I am Nur Arini, a Frontend Web Developer with experience in fullstack development. Based in Bandung, West Java, I am passionate about building modern and responsive web applications that deliver great user experiences.</p>
      <p>
        I graduated from SMKN 1 Majalaya with a major in Computer and Network Engineering, which gave me a solid technical foundation. Over the years, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in frontend technologies like React, NextJS, TypeScript, and
        Tailwind CSS, creating clean and intuitive web interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my current role, I not only focus on frontend development but also contribute to backend tasks, such as building scalable server-side applications, managing databases, and handling API integrations. My goal is to continue growing
        as a full-stack developer and work on projects that have a positive impact on users.
