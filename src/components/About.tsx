      <h1 className="font-bold text-3xl">ðŸš€About Me</h1>
      <p>With over 2 years of experience in web development, I specialize in building digital solutions that blend technical excellence with exceptional user experiences.</p>
      <p>
        For me, a website isnâ€™t just about beautiful design or clean code, it's about creating tools that solve real-world problems. Whether it's boosting sales, improving operational efficiency, or helping a brand connect with a wider
        audience, I aim to deliver results that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about modern web technologies, clean code practices, and developing applications that make a real impact on people's lives. As a Fullstack & Mobile Developer, I handle projects end-to-end from crafting intuitive user
        interfaces to developing reliable, scalable back-end systems.
